## Introduction

In this project I covered vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation, these are the two main steps in the vulnerability management lifecycle. I used Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation in order to run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation.

- Installed Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 hosts
- Implemented vulnerability management functions on sandbox networks
- Conducted vulnerability assesments with Nessus; remediated vulnerabilities
- Developed automated remediation process to preemptively deal with vulnerabilities stemming from Windows updates and third-party software


## Basic Network Port Scan

- Targeted VM IP address and ran manual scan
- Viewed and recorded indiviual results of initial scan


## Configured VM for Credentialed Scans

- Enabled Remote Registry to allow scanner to connect to VM's registry
- Turned on Network Discovery and File and Printer Sharing
- Lowered User Account Control Settings to its lowest setting (computer not on domain)
- Added key into Registry to allow Local account to connect in (from Nessus)


## Configred Nessus for Credentialed scan

- Added a set of windows credentials to initial scans configuration
- Ran the same initial scan but this time with credentials
- Measured differences between the two scans (file system, registry, runing services etc)
- Viewed and recorded individual results of credentialed scans


## Installed deprecated version of Firefox on Vm

- Ran same credentialed scan with old Firefox installed
- Inspected scan results and logged vulnerability increase in results

## Remediated some vulnerabilities


- Uninstalled old Firefox version
- Open Windows updates and manually checked for updates (restarted and repeated until updates were all up to date)
- Ran credentialed scan once more
-
